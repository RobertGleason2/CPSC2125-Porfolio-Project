        <h2> Instructions for Assignment 2 </h2>
    Assignment 2 – HTML Labs Portfolio Setup (Lab 2) – 20 Points – due Monday Tuesday 9/5 midnight <br><br>
If you have any corrections to make from your graded assignment 1, update those changes before you go on with this one. <br><br>
You will log into your repl.it account, fork your assignment 1 Repl.it to create a Repl.it for what we will call lab two.  Copy the prior index.html and rename it lab one.  Create a new page for lab 2.  Then you will write HTML code to turn the original index.html into the main page of a labs portfolio. <br><br>
Add navigation hyperlinks so the user can surf to all lab pages and back to index page.  The navigation should be on every page.  Put the instructions for lab one on the lab one page (as a text block under your original content for the assignment 1 HTML.  Similarly, put the instructions for this assignment on the lab 2 page.  Remember all text needs to be in block tags.  On the index page add some text saying welcome to your CPSC 2125 Labs 1-6 portfolio.  You will fork and add to this for the assignments that work with labs 3, 4, 5, and 6. <br><br>
To submit your work, get the shareable link (use the invite button to generate a join link) and paste it into the submission box in CougarView.  As long as I can get to your repl.it via the link, that’s all you need to turn in. <br><br>
Grading Checklist: <br>
•	Corrections to previous lab one/assignment one (if any) <br>
•	Index page that is the welcome page for your CPSC 2125 labs 1-6 portfolio <br>
•	Lab 1 page has HTML you wrote for assignment/lab 1 and the lab 1 instructions <br>
•	Lab 2 page has instructions for lab 2 <br>
•	All three pages have a navigation bar (list of navigation links) that lets you get to the other two pages <br>
•	All three pages have an appropriate title <br>
•	All text is contained in tags (no stray text), all tags are closed <br>
•	Repl.it link uploaded to CougarVIEW <br><br>
Note: Always cite what you write!  If you get code or content from somewhere you must include at least a URL or other source identification.  You must understand all the code you turn in.  It is plagiarism (academic dishonesty) to use code or content, in part or in whole, written by other people without proper attribution.  Failure to do so will result in a 0 on the assignment and may result in an academic misconduct report.
